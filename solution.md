# Summary

The solution was implemented using Apache Pig and bash scripts.

# Building the solution
```
docker build .
```
# Running the solution

Start the container
```
 ./run_container 2f37b7776b7c ${id/name of image}
```

Once inside the container run the tree scripts that generate the answers to the three questions in this assignment
```
./scripts/run_all
```
Once the scripts finish running the answers to the questions are stored in files located inside the container at
the following path:

/results_export/

There are three files:

| File name               | Contnents                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| line_count.csv          | the total number or rows for the all the .csv files    |
| average_field_count.csv | the average number of fields across all the .csv files |
| word_count.csv          | the word count of every value of every dataset         |

# Solution explanation
Apache pig was chosen because it can run in local mode. This means that it can operate on a local file system
and do all the work without the need for a Hadoop cluster backing it up.

This simplifed the solution because it made it self contained in one container.

To simplify feeding the data files to Apache pig, the choice was made to move all CSV files from the locations where
they are downloaded into a single folder `data_flat`.

This allowed Apache pig to read all the files from one location.

The line count solution was implemented using unix's `wc -l` command with some additional help from `tail` and `sed`.

# Data persistance

Once the container exists the data files generated by the aformentioned scripts are located in the `~/output` folder
